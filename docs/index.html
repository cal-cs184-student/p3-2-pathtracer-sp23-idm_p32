                Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.

        </p>
        <p style="line-height:200%">
            Here is the explanation of why these particular multibounce effects happen:
            <ul>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 0 equals to <b>zero_bounce_illumination</b>, so only direct lighting effects are seen.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 1 equals to <b>one_bound_illumination.</b>, so we can only see the light where it can direcly reflect the light from
                    the light source to our camera.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 2, we can see the light on the back sphere, because we now can observe the light that is first reflected from other objects 
                    and reflected from the back sphere to the camera. We can not see the front sphere because it relies on refraction. 
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 3, we can finally see the refraction of light inside the ball and it appears as glass.  
                    Why we need three bounces: The light is first reflected from other objects to the ball (1 bounce) and the light need to
                    pass through the ball through refraction (2 bounces). So the total required number of bounces is 3.
                    We also notice that the reflection of the walls of the box on the mirror ball are lit, as light rays have enough depth to bounce on the wall, on to the mirror ball, and into the camera.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 4, there are two differences: we now can observe a concentrated spot on light on the right wall and the reflectance
                    of the front ball inside the second ball begins to have light. Why these differences happen: because we have finished refraction through 3 bounces
                    so the light after 3 bounces can reflect on other objects to generate light reflection. 
                </li>

                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    It is very hard to see the differences start from m = 4 because after four bounces already capture all the important lighting effects.
                    The light already passes through all the glass spheres in this scene and return back to the camera after 4 bounces.
                </li>
            </ul>
