        </p>
        <p style="line-height:200%">
            Here is the explanation of why these particular multibounce effects happen:
            <ul>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 0 equals to <b>zero_bounce_illumination</b>, so only direct lighting effects are seen.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 1 equals to <b>one_bound_illumination.</b>, so we can only see the light where it can direcly reflect the light from
                    the light source to our camera.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 2, we can see the light on the back sphere, because we now can observe the light that is first reflected from other objects
                    and reflected from the back sphere to the camera. We can not see the front sphere because it relies on refraction.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 3, we can finally see the refraction of light inside the ball and it appears as glass.
                    Why we need three bounces: The light is first reflected from other objects to the ball (1 bounce) and the light need to
                    pass through the ball through refraction (2 bounces). So the total required number of bounces is 3.
                    We also notice that the reflection of the walls of the box on the mirror ball are lit, as light rays have enough depth to bounce on the wall, on to the mirror ball, and into the camera.
                </li>
                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    m = 4, there are two differences: we now can observe a concentrated spot on light on the right wall and the reflectance
                    of the front ball inside the second ball begins to have light. Why these differences happen: because we have finished refraction through 3 bounces
                    so the light after 3 bounces can reflect on other objects to generate light reflection.
                </li>

                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    It is very hard to see the differences start from m = 4 because after four bounces already capture all the important lighting effects.
                    The light already passes through all the glass spheres in this scene and return back to the camera after 4 bounces.
                </li>

            We changed the Alpha value from 0.005 to 0.5. Alpha value is the roughness value of a macro surface. As the instruction mentioned,
            The smaller alpha is, the smoother the macro surface will be. In other words, the macro surface tends to be diffuse when
            alpha is large and glossy when alpha is small. This phenomena can be observed from the pictures above. For the dragon with
            alpha = 0.005, we can easily see the reflection of walls on the dragon's surface.

                <li style="line-height:200%">
                    <b>Cosine hemisphere sampling</b>: Cosine hemisphere sampling involves generating random points on the hemisphere centered at
                    the surface normal, where the probability of selecting a point is proportional to the cosine of the angle
                    between the surface normal and the direction of the point.However, cosine hemisphere sampling does not take into account the reflectance properties of the material,
                    and can result in a large number of samples being wasted on areas of the hemisphere where the reflectance is low. So because of our low sampling
                    rate, the rendering result on the microfacet surface contains a lot of noise.

                    <b>Importance sampling</b>: Importance sampling involves generating samples based on the reflectance properties of the material.
                    This means that samples are more likely to be generated in areas where the reflectance is high,
                    resulting in a more efficient use of the samples.
                    This can lead to a significant improvement in rendering quality and efficiency, which can be observed in the example image.

                    <b>Why do we need environment lighting</b>: By using an environment lighting, the lighting of the scene can be made more realistic and immersive,
                    as the objects in the scene will reflect the lighting information from their surroundings. This can help to create a more convincing virtual environment for applications such as video games,
                    virtual reality, and architectural visualization.

                    <b>How environment lighting works</b>: Environment lighting refers to the use of an environment map to simulate
                    the effect of indirect lighting in a scene.An environment map is a texture that encodes the lighting information of
                    the surrounding environment as seen from a given viewpoint.The environment map is then used to illuminate objects in the scene by calculating the
                    indirect lighting contribution from the environment.In this assignment, we implemented two sampling methods (<b>Importance sampling</b>
                    and <b>uniform sampling</b>) to get the corresponding
                    environment light for each rendering ray.

            It is very easy to observe that the noise level in the importance sampling is much lower than the noise level utilizing
            uniform sampling. (very obvious especially on the white cushion). Also, for the bunny's surface, the surface of the importance sampling
            is smoother than the uniform sampling.

                Use a different image (if you did part 2, we recommend `bunny_microfacet_cu_unlit.dae`) and your environment map *.exr* file and render two pictures, one with uniform sampling and one with importance sampling. Use 4 samples per pixel and 64 samples per light in each. Compare noise levels. Make sure to include all screenshots.

            We think the noise level comparision is nearly the same as the above experiment.  The noise level of the importance sampling is much lower than the noise level utilizing
            uniform sampling.
